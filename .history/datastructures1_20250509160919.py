# Task 1 - Working with Lists


##fruits = ['apples','orange','strawberries','cherry','date']
# fruits.append("bananna")
# print(fruits)

# fruits.remove("cherry")
# print(fruits)
# fruits[::-1]
# print(fruits)

# Task 2 - Exploring Dictionaries

# Create a dictionary to store information about yourself with the following keys: "name", "age", "city".
# Add a new key-value pair to the dictionary for "favorite color".
# Update the "city" key with a new value.
# Print all the keys and values using a loop.
# Example Output:

# Keys: name, age, city, favorite color
# Values: Alice, 25, New York, Blue

myInfo = {"name": "akira", "age": 21, "city": "atlanta"}
myInfo = ["color"] = "Pink"
myInfo["city"]= "Conyers"

for info in myInfo:
    print(myInfo)
# Task 3 - Using Tuples

# Create a tuple with three elements: your favorite movie, song, and book.
# Try to change one of the elements (youâ€™ll see why tuples are immutable!).
# Print the length of the tuple using the len() function.
# Example Output:

# Favorite things: ('Inception', 'Bohemian Rhapsody', '1984')
# Oops! Tuples cannot be changed.
# Length of tuple: 3
