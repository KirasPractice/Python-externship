# fruits.append("bananna")
# print(fruits)

# fruits.remove("cherry")
# print(fruits)
# fruits[::-1]

# myInfo["Fav Color"]="Pink"

# for info in myInfo:
#     print(myInfo)
# Task 3 - Using Tuples

# Create a tuple with three elements: your favorite movie, song, and book.
# Try to change one of the elements (youâ€™ll see why tuples are immutable!).
# Print the length of the tuple using the len() function.
# Example Output:

# Favorite things: ('Inception', 'Bohemian Rhapsody', '1984')
# Oops! Tuples cannot be changed.
# Length of tuple: 3

FavThings = ("Startstruck","Forever","The unger games")
FavThings["Forever"]="Stay with me"
